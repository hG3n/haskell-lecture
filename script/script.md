####Three keypoints of functional progamming:
 - FP is a method of progam constructions that empasize functions and their application rather than commands and their executions
 - PF uses "simple" mathematical notation that allows concise description of problems
 - PF has strong mathemathical basis

####The most important properties of Haskell:

1. High Order Functions (HOF)
  If functions are treated as first class values in a language - allowing them to be stored in data-structures, passed as arguments $\rightarrow$ return as results $\rightarrow$ referred as HOF.
  Function map takes a function and approximates it to a list: \newline
  Haskell: `(a -> a) -> [a] -> [a]` \newline
  Example: consider the following function twice $f(x) = f(f(x))$

2. Nonstrict Semantic (Lazy Evaluation)
  Lazy evaluation or call by need is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed, and which also avoids repeated evaluations \newline
  $f(2,\frac{3}{0})$ // something

3. Data abstraction
4. Equation and pattern matching

####Further features
- pure functional
    - `"Hello" ++ "World"`
    - `"Hello" ++ getLine     // compiler Error -> getLine has type IO-String
- type inference
- something
- lazy
- packages

#$\lambda$-calculus

What is a foundation of mathematics?

- Set theory was introduced by Georg Cantor in 1874-1884
    - $A=\{1,2,3,...\} \rightarrow$ IN
    - $A=\{x | x \in F \}$  //A contains x for $x \in F$ \newline
      $\{x | x < 10 \&\& x > 2 , x\in Z\}$ \newline
      $\rightarrow \{3..9\}$
- Russel Paradox founded in 1901
    - shows that the naive set theory is inconsistent
    - let $R$ be a set of all sets that are not member of themselves
    - 'The barber is a man in town who shaves all those, and only those, men in town who do not shave themselves'
- Axiomatic set theory
    - ZFC(1908-1922) and NBG(1925-1945)
- $\lambda$-calculus introduced in 1930 by Alonso Church
- category theory by Eilenberg and MacLane (1942-1945)
    - Paper [A Short introduction to $\lambda$-calculus](http://pastuhova.ucoz.ru/_ld/0/78_lambda-calculus.pdf) by A. Jung

#### Lecture 2 (19.10.15)

Typed and untyped:
- $\lambda$-calculus developed by Anlonzo Church in 1930s
- One of original goals was to construct a formal system for the foundation of mathematics by having a system of fucntions together with a set of logical notions
- When it tuned out that the constructed system was inconsistent Church this program was forgotten by him.
- Then later Church separated the consistent subsystem and focussed on comptability.
- known as untyped LC
- Systems using LC:
    - LISP (not based on LC)
    - ML
    - Haskell

### untyped LC
- The LC is a calculus of pure functions
- Let us consider the following function: $f(x) = x^2 + x + 1$
- We speak in terms of a name the argument and the result:
    - $f$ is a function which, when applied to any argument $x$ returns $x^2 + x + 1$
    - $g(x) = x^2 + x + 1$ == $g(y) = y^2 + y + 1$
- can we describe and define functions without giving them names?
- LC allows us to do so
- LC is a notation for functions (short but cryptic) which takes its origin in mathematical logic
- Expressions in LC are written in the strict prefix form, that is, there are no infix and postfix operations.
- Furthermore functions and their arguments are simply written next to each other
    - examples: 
        - $sin(x) \rightarrow sin\ x$
        - $x+4 \rightarrow + x\ 4\ $
        - $x^2 \rightarrow *\ x\ x\$ 
- Brackets are used only to enforce a special grouping:
    - example: 
        - $sin(x) + 4 \rightarrow (sin\ x\ ) 4\ $
- If an expression contains a variable $(x)$, then one can form the function which obtains by considering the relationship between concrete values of $x$ and the resulting value of expression
- In mathematics, function formation is sometimes written as an equation, $f(x)=3x$, or sometimes as a mapping $f:x \rightarrow 3x$
- In the LC a special notation is available which dispenses the need to give a name to the function and which easily scales up to more complicated function definitions.
- In the example above, we will write $3x$ as $*\ 3\ x\ $ and turn it into a function by preceding $\lambda x .  \rightarrow \lambda x. *\ 3\ x\ $
- The letter $\lambda$ has a role similar to keyword in some programming languages `function`
- The variable which comes ater #\lambda$ is not part of an expression, but a formal parameter.
- The $.$ tells that here starts the function body.
    - We have LAMBDA __ . __ ZETTEL 1 


- Let us consider a function $x^2 + y$
- This can be thought of as a function on $x$ (y is fixed in this case), or it can be a fucntion on $y$(x is fixed), and it can be a function on $x$ and $y$
- To make a distinction between these cases, LC provides the so called abstraction.
- To see how it works, let us consider a function $x \mapsto x^2 + y$
- To make a clear distinction between the \underline{bound} variable $x$ and the \underline{unbounded} variable $y$ we introduce an explicit variable binder, and we write:
    - $\lambda x . + (*\ x\ x)y$ // x $\rightarrow$ bounded variable
    - $\lambda z . + (*\ z\ z)y$

### The pure LC
- The funciton which has been LAMBDA notation can itself be used in an expression.
- For example, the application of the function $3x$ to a value $4$ is written as $(\lambda x. *\ 3\ x) 4$
- As we already mentioned the representation by means of LAMBDA bindings offers a general way to write functions.
- In case a function takes several arguments we need to use several bound variables.
    - example: $\lambda x.\lambda y. +(*\ x\ x)y$
    - ($\lambda x.\lambda y. +(*\ x\ x)y$) 3 $\rightarrow \lambda y. _(*\ 3\ 3) y$
- For applying a function to its argument we use juxtaposition:
    - if $F$ is a function expression and $A$ is an argument expression, then $(F\ A)$ denotes the application of $F$ to $A$.
        - example: $f(x)=x^2+1 \quad\quad A = sin y$
        - $f(A) = (sin y)^2 + 1$ 
- Although it is not strictly necessary, it will be convenient to introduce an abbreviation for LAMBDA terms.
- If we abbreviate our function term to $F$.
    - BLATT 3
- now we write $F\ 4$, instead of (3. formel)
- Suppose the body of a function consists of another function:
    - BLATT 4
- If we apply this function to the value $3$ then we get back BLATT 5
- In other words $N$ is a function which when applied to a number returns another function.
- If we want to underline that $N$ is a function of two arguments then we should leave the brackets out
- That means we have B6 or, as typically used we can omit the second LAMBDA:
    - $\lambda y\ x. *\ y\ x$
- Function formation and function application are all there is in pure LC.
- They can be mixed freely and used as often as desired or needed
- Which is another way of saying that LAMBDA terms are constructed according to the grammar
    - $M::=c | x | M\ N| \lambda x. M$
    - where $c$ represents any constant we might use in a LAMBDA-term, such as numbers or arithmetic operations (a term without a constant is called pure $\lambda x. x$), the letter $x$ represents any of inifinitely manay variables $M\ N$ is an application of one term $M$ to another term $N$
    - $\lambda x. M$ is an abstraction
